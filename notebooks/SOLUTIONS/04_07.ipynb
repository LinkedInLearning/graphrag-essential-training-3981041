This Congress then met every year or so to hear from the CIS and refine and adopt rule changes.  The commission was to consist of two members - a representative of Scandinavia and Central Europe. Ultimately, two Scandinavians sat on the commission. A year later, in March 1911, the first internationally valid set of rules was approved. At that time, the commission was enlarged to five members, and Oslo was elected as headquarters.\\nIn 1913, the number of members of the commission was increased to seven: two Norwegians, two Swedes, a Swiss, a German and an Austrian.\\nOn February 2, 1924, in Chamonix as part of the \"International Winter Sports Week\", which was later to be recognized as the first Olympic Winter Games, 36 delegates from 14 countries (Great Britain, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, Yugoslavia, Norway, Poland, Romania, US, Switzerland, Sweden, Hungary and Italy) decided to found the FIS, which replaced the CIS.\\nInitially, the FIS was only responsible for Nordic skiing.  FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1925 in Janské Lázně, Czechoslovakia, were given status as the first official World Championships. After the Scandinavian countries had relented, it was decided at the 11th FIS Congress (February 24–26, 1930 in Oslo) to also include alpine skiing (downhill, slalom and alpine combined) in the rules. This was upon a proposal by Great Britain, in which the British ski pioneer Arnold Lunn played a major role as co-founder of the Arlberg-Kandahar races. The simple sentence \"Downhill and slalom races may be organized\" was written into the rules - a sentence that was to change skiing in the long term. The first FIS Alpine World Ski Championships were held 19–23 February 1931 in Mürren, Switzerland.\\nSki flying, a variation of ski jumping, was recognized as a discipline in 1938, but rules were not finalized until after World War II.\\n\\n\\n=== List of Ski Congresses ===\\n\\n\\n== Presidents ==\\n\\n\\n== Members ==\\n\\n\\n== Official ', 'source': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ski_and_Snowboard_Federation', 'title': 'International Ski and Snowboard Federation'}]}, {'path': [{'id': 'International Ski And Snowboard Federation'}, 'RECOGNIZED_SKI_FLYING', {'id': '1938'}, 'MENTIONS', {'summary': 'The International Ski and Snowboard Federation, also known as FIS (French: Fédération Internationale de Ski et de Snowboard), is the highest international governing body for skiing and snowboarding.
